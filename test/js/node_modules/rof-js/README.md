# Rust Object Format (.rof)

Rust object format allows rust objects to be serialized to a file in a text format very closely resembling the original object. It also allows easy transfer of objects between different programming langauges, as the objects can be created in their respective language, serialized to string, send to another programming language, deserialzed and used once again.

TL;DR A library that can serialize and deserialize rust objects to string which allows simple file saving and transmission of rust objects between separate programming languages.
